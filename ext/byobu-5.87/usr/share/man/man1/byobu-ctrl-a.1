.SH NAME
byobu\-ctrl\-a \- Configure Byobu's ctrl-a behavior

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbyobu\-ctrl\-a\fP is an interactive program that allows a user to configure the behavior of the 'ctrl-a' key sequence.

Traditional GNU \fBscreen\fP(1) uses ctrl-a as its escape character, while GNU \fBemacs\fP(1) uses ctrl-a to move the cursor to the beginning of the line.  This conflict has caused unending amounts of grief among Screen, Byobu, and Emacs-mode users.

Thus, this program exists to allow each user to choose the behavior of ctrl-a in their local environment.
