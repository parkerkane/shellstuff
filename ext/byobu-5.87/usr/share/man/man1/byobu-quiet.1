.SH NAME
byobu\-quiet \- Silence all of Byobu's status indicators and eliminate the hardstatus line

.SH USAGE
byobu\-quiet [\-\-undo]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbyobu\-quiet\fP will disable ALL of Byobu's status indicators and eliminate the hardstatus line.

Some administrators, in some environments, at some times may prefer a very minimal, quiet Byobu, without the potentially distracting status indicators and eye candy.  However, the window menu is preserved, as well as all of Byobu's keybindings and helper utilities.  To elminate the window list, use \fBbyobu-silent\fP(1).
