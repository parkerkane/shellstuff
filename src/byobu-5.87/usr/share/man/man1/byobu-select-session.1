.SH NAME
byobu\-select\-session \- select and connect to a byobu session

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbyobu\-select\-session\fP is an application that lists the available screen sessions running on the system, and prompts the user to select one.  The user also has the option to create a new Byobu session, or launch the default shell without Byobu.

If an invalid selection is chosen 3 times in a row, the user is connected to the youngest session.

By default, if only one session exists, the user is connected to that session, and if no sessions exist, a new session is created -- such that there is no interactive prompt in the normal behavior.  However, some users may choose to always be prompted, by touching the file $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/.always-select.

Note that BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR=$HOME/.byobu.

Named sessions that begin with a "." are "hidden" from \fBbyobu\-select\-session\fP(1).  This is useful, for instance, if you do not want a session to be automatically selected at login.  Example:
  byobu \-S .hidden
