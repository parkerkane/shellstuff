.SH DESCRIPTION

Byobu provides a special PS1 prompt command, compatible with Bash shells.  It will display the previous command's exit code, if it's not zero.  It will use 3 separate colors for the local username, hostname, and the current working directory.

\fBbyobu-enable-prompt\fP will add one line to your \fI~/.bashrc\fP.

You can safely remove the line from your \fI~/.bashrc\fP, which ends in \fB#byobu-prompt\fP.

\fBbyobu-disable-prompt\fP will remove its color configuration from \fI~/.bashrc\fP.

\fBbyobu-prompt\fP is an interactive wrapper of the previous two tools.

.SH "BUGS"

This is currently only compatible with \fBbash(1)\fP.
