.SH NAME
byobu-keybindings \- toggle on/off Byobu's keybindings

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbyobu-keybindings\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbyobu-keybindings\fP toggles on and off Byobu's keybindings in the current \fBtmux\fP(1) or \fBscreen\fP(1) session.  It will only operate against the current session.

This executable is provided as an alternative to pressing <Shift>-F12, and is useful in environments where <Shift>-F12 does not work (e.g., on the Linux console TTY).

Some Byobu users toggle these keybindings when they interfere with other programs using the same keybindings (e.g., \fBmc\fP(1)).
