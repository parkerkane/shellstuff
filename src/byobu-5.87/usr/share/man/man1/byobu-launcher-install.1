.SH NAME
byobu\-launcher\-install \- Byobu Launcher installation utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
byobu\-launcher\-install [\-n|\-\-no\-logout]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbyobu\-launcher\-install\fP(1) is a simple utilty that will add a line to your \fI$HOME/.profile\fP file which launches \fBbyobu\fP(1) any time you login through \fBssh\fP(1) or on a \fBconsole\fP(4).

By default, when users detach from the \fBbyobu\fP(1) session they will also logout.  Users can change this behavior by adding the [\-n|\-\-no\-logout] option when they run \fBbyobu\-launcher\-install\fP(1).

You can disable this behavior entirely at any time with the \fBbyobu\-launcher\-uninstall\fB(1) utility.
